\section{Conclusion}

A conceptual structural design study of an aircraft wing box has been presented. The work focused on establishing a realistic wing box architecture capable of resisting representative bending, shear, and torsional loads encountered during flight.

By defining a credible design context and representative load cases, a closed-section wing box geometry was developed that reflects conventional aerospace structural practice. The use of parametric CAD modeling enabled clear visualization of internal load paths and supported the structural reasoning presented throughout the report.

While detailed stress sizing and certification-level analysis were beyond the scope of this study, the resulting design demonstrates a sound understanding of aircraft primary structures and early-stage structural decision-making. The project provides a strong foundation for future refinement through numerical analysis, material optimization, and integration of additional structural features.

Overall, this work serves as a portfolio-quality demonstration of aerospace structural design principles, engineering judgment, and technical communication.
